# Product_Managment
This project is an official exercise as part of the [JAVA ORACLE SE 21](https://education.oracle.com/fr/ouexam-pexam_1z0-830/pexam_1Z0-830). The main objective is to develop a Java application that manages and classifies restaurant products based on customer reviews. Products will be rated on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, based on customer ratings and comments.
## Project Objectives
1. **Product Management** : Create a system that allows adding, modifying, deleting, and viewing restaurant products.
2. **Review Management** : Enable customers to leave reviews (ratings and comments) on products. 
3. **Product Classification** : Classify products based on the average of customer ratings.
4. **Advanced Java Concepts** : Implement object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, abstract classes, interfaces, lambda expressions, streams, and annotations.
5. **Security** : Integrate Java security techniques to protect sensitive data.
